# Radooks

Radooks aims to revolutionize the way animated series are created and distributed, focusing on automating the animation process for series targeted at audiences over 12 years old. The project encompasses a comprehensive platform that not only automates the creation of animated series with compelling storylines but also hosts them on a futuristic website where users can download the series upon completion.

## Overview

The Radooks platform is built on a modern technology stack that includes Node.js for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and Express for server management.
